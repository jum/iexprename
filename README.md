iexprename.go
=============

A small command line utility to rename the result of an iPhoto export with the event names option turned on to a folder hierarchy "year/month/event". The utility is written in the [go](http://golang.org) language.

The current version hardcodes the month names to be German, but this is easy to change in the source code.
